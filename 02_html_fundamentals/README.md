Last week we started to learn basic `HTML` syntax.  

Discussion:

- Look at the source of a favorite website and see if you can find any elements (use Ctrl-F). What other familiar tags can you spot?
- Show students how to use shortcuts to copy-paste code. 
  - For Windows itâ€™s ctrl + c and ctrl + v
  - For Mac cmd + c and cmd + v


Please have the students continue woking on  [codecademy.com](http://www.codecademy.com/).

- Go to the [Web Fundumentals](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web)
  - Finish up the __HTML Basics__.
  - Complete __Build your own web page__ exercise.  


**We will discuss the web pages they created next week**
